# Benchmarking knowledge transfer methods in de novo materials discovery

## Setup

### 0. Clone the repository
Clone the repository with `git clone --recurse-submodules` in order to also clone the submodules. Use `
git submodule update --init --recursive` if you did not clone with submodule. Finally, use `git submodule update` to update the submodules.

#### [REINVENT4](https://github.com/MolecularAI/REINVENT4)
Requires additional setup, follow the instructions in their README. Everything should be installed as a separate venv (i.e. `.reinvnet_venv`) with `uv`. In general, all command from the README should simply be preceeded by `uv`, i.e. `uv pip install ...`.

#### [Mol-AIR](https://github.com/wtaisner/Mol-AIR)
Setup is already done with `uv`.

### 1. Python environment

#### Mamba/Conda
Using either `conda` or `mamba`, run `mamba env create -f environment.yaml` to create an environment.
Use `mamba activate battery` to activate it in the terminal.

#### UV
Assuming you have `uv` installed, you can run `uv sync --all-extras --build` to install the environment.

### 2. [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com)
Install pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`. From now on, it will run check automatically on `git commit`.

You can also run it manually with `pre-commit run --all-files`.
